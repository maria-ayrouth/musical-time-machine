# musical-time-machine

by this python time machine , we will go back in the time to fing the music that was in the topp 100 shots that was being played all over the radio so that you can relive that period of time one cmore through music .

billboard complies a list of the top 100 songs , and there also a feature where you can change the date to any data in the past .
so we are using Beautiful soup to scrape the top 100 songs from a particular date of your choice  , and then we're oing to extract all of the song titles from the list . and then we're going to use the Spotify API to create a playliste for that particular date .and we see  right through spotify for each of the songs and add those songs to our new playlist .
by the end  , we end up with a playlist that has the top 100 songs for a particular date in the past.
